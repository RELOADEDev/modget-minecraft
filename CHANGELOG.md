## Beta 0.3.0
Update to Modget Manifest API 0.2.0

## Beta 0.2.3
- Add `/modget repos add <repo url>` and `/modget repos remove <repo id>` commands, although not yet persistent
- Fix some issues with commands

## Beta 0.2.2
- Only require the actually needed fabric api modules (and bundle them)
- Recommend Server Translations API instead of requiring it
- Show message when no updates are found
- Output "Searching for mod updates..." after starting the upgrade command

## Beta 0.2.1
Now with 1.17 support! Requires Server Translations.

## Beta 0.2.0
This version contains no new features, but it has been completely rebased on top of our new APIs. Also, going offline should be handled much better now!

## Beta 0.1.2
Don't fail when parsing manifests with unrecognized fields

## Beta 0.1.1
Add the `/modget search` command

## Beta 0.1.0
Our first beta release! The overall stability has been improved greatly, and modget finally works server-side and client-side only.

## Alpha 0.0.3
Rebase on top of modget-lib. Nothing new functionality-wise.

## Alpha 0.0.2
The second alpha release of Modget! Still not production ready, but should have most severe bugs ironed out. It includes a huge refactor with much groundwork being done for faster development in the future.

## Alpha 0.0.1
Initial release
